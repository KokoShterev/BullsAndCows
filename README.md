# Bulls and Cows

**Bulls and Cows** (also known as **Cows and Bulls**) is an old code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players. The numerical version of the game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 3 or any other number of digits.
On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different and can't start with zero. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows".

Example:
- Secret number: 4271
- Opponent's try: 1234
- Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)

The first one to reveal the other's secret number in the least number of guesses wins the game.
